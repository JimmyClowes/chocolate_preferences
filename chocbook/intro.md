# Modelling chocolate preferences from ranking data

This book works through an analysis of ranking data relating to relative preferences of a selection of chocolates carried out by a number of people.

The book follows the process of [Modern Statistical Workflow](https://khakieconomics.github.io/2016/08/29/What-is-a-modern-statistical-workflow.html), which is applicable to the development of Bayesian models and aims to ensure models are fit for purpose by testing them on simulated data so that they can be trusted on real data.
